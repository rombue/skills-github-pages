To make conjectures is an essential part of mathematical practice. A good conjecture can captivate generations of mathematicians and shape the development of entire fields. In this talk, I would like to examine one particular case: Legendre's conjecture of what is now known as the prime number theorem. Considering that it took a century to prove, this is a rather extraordinary case of conjecturing. However, by reconstructing the epistemological context, in which Legendre formulated and refined his conjecture, I will try to show that it was not the result of a lucky guess, or mere hunch. Legendre may have had an exceptional intuition that led him to "see the end from afar" (to borrow Poincar√©'s words). But he also had reasons to believe in the truth of the proposition he had found. And as we shall see, these reasons were of different kinds: numerical, one might say empirical, on the one hand, and on the other, more conceptual and linked to a sieve method he had developed.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c167583-cdd1-46f4-8106-f325d62737a0)
